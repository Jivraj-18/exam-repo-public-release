## Question 1
In which scenario would Mean Absolute Error (MAE) be preferred over Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) when evaluating a machine learning model? Explain your reasoning.

## Question 2
What is API rate limiting? Why is it important when deploying Large Language Model (LLM) based services?

## Question 3
Can two models have the same MAE but different RMSE values? Justify your answer with an explanation.

## Question 4
How does API rate limiting protect both the service provider and the application user? Explain from a system reliability perspective.

## Question 5
What are the risks of directly exposing LLM APIs to end users without implementing server-side controls?
