### Question Information: Classification and Churn Prediction

This question tests your ability to work with classification problems in machine learning. You'll need to:

- Load and explore data from a CSV file
- Analyze class distribution (churn vs. retention)
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Build a classification model (logistic regression or decision tree)
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

### Key Concepts:

- Class imbalance and churn rate
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Train-test split for validation

### Tools you can use:

- Python with pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook
- Any ML framework (XGBoost, TensorFlow, etc.)

### Verification:

The correct churn rate can be calculated by counting churned customers and dividing by total customers, then multiplying by 100.
